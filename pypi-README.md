eggplant is a tool that transfers information from multiple different spatial
transcriptomics data sets to a single reference representing a common
coordinate framework (CCF).

The package is compatible with `scanpy` and its derivatives as well as with
`anndata`.

We refer to the
[Documentation](https://spatial-eggplant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eggplant.html#)
for more information about installation and examples of use. You can also visit
the [github](https://github.com/almaan/eggplant) page to find instructions on
how to access example data sets and the associated manuscript.
